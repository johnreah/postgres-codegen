                Access can be FIELD or PROPERTY. According to the link below, setting this to FIELD should cause
                hbm2java to generate field annotations rather than property (getter) annotations. I couldn't make
                this work, and instead used the template override approach described in the same article. However
                you do need to set it to FIELD after making this change so that Hibernate looks for annotated
                fields rather than property getters.
